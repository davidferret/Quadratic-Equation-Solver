# Quadratic Equation Solver

This program solves quadratic equations, determines the nature of the roots, and offers an option to visualize the function. It ensures that the input is valid, and calculates both real and complex roots based on the discriminant.

You can use this program to solve quadratic equations and determine if the roots are real or complex by evaluating the discriminant. The program checks that the coefficient `a` is nonzero, ensuring the equation is valid. It also provides a graphical representation of the quadratic function over a set range of x-values, allowing you to visualize the behavior of the equation.

I built this program to help simplify solving quadratic equations and to provide a deeper understanding of how their roots are determined. I’ve always been interested in algebra and wanted to create a tool that would make the process of solving and visualizing quadratics more intuitive. By calculating both real and complex roots, as well as offering the option to graph the equation, this tool is designed to support learning and help you gain more insight into quadratic functions.

Do you want to see the step-by-step solution? (y/n): y
Step 1: Compute the discriminant
Discriminant = ( -3^2 ) - 4 * 1 * 2 = 1
Step 2: Compute the roots
Root formula: (-b ± sqrt(discriminant)) / (2a)
